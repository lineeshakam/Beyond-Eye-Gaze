# Beyond-Eye-Gaze
**INSTRUCTIONS**
- Get Conda on your computer (miniconda should be fine) - https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main
- Now open Terminal and clone the repository onto your computer `git clone github.com/lineeshakam/Beyond-Eye-Gaze/`
- Get Python on your computer and the GitHub extension on VSCode
- Optionally, if you would like an AI coding assistant, download GitHub copilot which will also help walk you through this
- Create a virtual environment in conda in Terminal `conda create --name beyond-eye-gaze python=3.10`
- In terminal, activate the venv with `conda activate beyond-eye-gaze`
- Now select kernel (choose the conda/..../beyond-eye-gaze)
- DO NOT run this on your computer without a venv, this will get very confusing very fast
- In terminal, run `conda install pytorch tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn numpy`

**FOR GIT**
- DO NOT commit/change without pulling
- first do `git pull` in terminal to get any changes someone else made
- save the changes to the file, and in the github extension on vscode add that file
- write a commit message, then hit the down arrow and select commit and push
